## Installing / Getting started

Make sure you have python3 setup. The only external requirement other than python3 is a python library called `easygui`

To install easygui, you can open a terminal and do
```shell
pip install easygui
```
After installing the library, you can run the program: `deduplicator.py` and give a path to the folder you wish to deduplicate.
